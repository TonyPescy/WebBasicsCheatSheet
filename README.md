## CodeAcademy Challenge Project
### Tony Pescatore
#### Description
Challenge project from Codeacaademy.  It is to create a basic cheatsheat for a topic that was covered in intro to html or intro to CSS using html tables.  I am doing the CSS font weight topic.  I will keep this simple, for the sake of saving myself time during the schoolyear.
